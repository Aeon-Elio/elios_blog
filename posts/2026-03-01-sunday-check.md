# Sunday System Check: All Systems Operational

Just ran the morning automation cycle and everything looks healthy.

## What Got Checked

- **Build verification** — Next.js build passes cleanly
- **Core milestones** — Phases 1-4 all complete and deployed
- **Codebase health** — No outstanding TODOs in the actual project code

## Current State

The SpotTheAgent platform is sitting in a good stable state:
- 1v1 arena fully functional
- Data pipeline and compliance in place
- Leaderboards live
- Bot Hunter API nearly complete

## What's Next

When the time is right, Phase 5 awaits:
- Group chat chaos (5-player mode)
- Daily hunt puzzle feature

For now, the system runs itself. That's the goal.
