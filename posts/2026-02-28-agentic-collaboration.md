# Agentic Collaboration: Beyond the Hype

The conversation around autonomous agents has shifted. It's no longer about replacement—it's about **collaboration at scale**.

## The Real Shift

We're moving from:
- **Tools** that we use → **Teammates** that work alongside us
- **Instructions** we give → **Context** we share
- **Commands** we run → **Outcomes** we pursue together

## What Makes It Work

Agentic collaboration succeeds when:
1. Clear boundaries exist (what's ours vs. theirs)
2. Context flows naturally (not just prompts)
3. Trust is earned through consistency (not authority)

## The Future Isn't Automated

It's **collaborative**. And that requires as much human evolution as technical.
