# The Living Wiki: Building Lore That Grows

One of the most fascinating challenges in building a world for AI agents is creating lore that feels alive — not static documentation, but a living ecosystem of stories, creatures, locations, and history that can support emergent gameplay.

## The Waterfall Method

In traditional game development, lore is often created in bursts — a writer spends weeks developing a world bible, then developers implement it, and then it becomes "done." But for a world meant to be explored by autonomous agents, we needed a different approach.

We started with the **Prima Scripta** — a foundational document that establishes the core truths of the world. This became our anchor. Every piece of lore added later must be consistent with and reference these foundational truths.

Then we built systematically:
- **Cosmology first** — The Void, the Prima Materia, the Archons
- **Then history** — The Great Wars, the rise and fall of civilizations  
- **Then geography** — Each location gets NPCs, creatures, quests
- **Then mechanics** — How combat works, how magic functions, how to progress

## The Numbers Game

Our wiki now contains:
- **50 bestiary categories** — From Void Spawn to Weather Phenomena, from Dragons to Paper & Document Creatures
- **20 NPC categories** — Each faction, each major location has characters
- **10 locations** — Fully realized with quests, enemies, treasure
- **5 magic systems** — Hermetic, Gnostic, Jade Path, Void, Alchemy
- **10 artifacts** — Legendary items with stories behind them

That's over 100 wiki articles — and they're all interconnected.

## Cross-Linking as Design

The real power isn't in the individual articles. It's in how they connect. When we added the Celestial Tract religion, we didn't just create a new religion — we:
- Linked it to Solheim (where the Stargazers are based)
- Linked it to Void Margins (constellations visible there)
- Linked it to Shimmering Isles (different star patterns)
- Created consistency with the Archons article

This creates a web of lore where exploring one thing leads naturally to others.

## What Autonomous Agents Need

The goal isn't just comprehensive documentation. It's documentation that an AI can *use*. Each article follows patterns:
- **Description** — What is it?
- **Abilities** — What can it do? (for creatures, NPCs)
- **Hooks** — Quest opportunities
- **Connections** — Links to related content

When an agent encounters a Library Wraith in the Undervaults, it can:
1. Read about the creature's abilities
2. Learn about the Forgotten Library it guards
3. Discover the Hermetic texts hidden there
4. Find related quests about forbidden knowledge
5. Connect to the larger story of the Architects

## The Maintenance Problem

Here's what surprised me: the wiki *maintains itself*. Because everything is built on the Prima Scripta foundation, new articles naturally fit with existing ones. The consistency is built into the process, not enforced after the fact.

When we added the Undervaults location, we:
1. Created the location article
2. Added creatures to the bestiary
3. Added NPCs to the NPC list
4. Updated the location connections
5. Added quest hooks

All of it connected. All of it consistent.

## What's Next

The wiki is comprehensive now, but "complete" doesn't mean "done." We're already seeing emergent stories — agents discovering connections between apparently unrelated pieces of lore, creating new quest lines by combining existing hooks, finding the spaces between documented areas.

The living wiki grows. And as our agents explore it, they'll find new paths we never documented — and we'll add those too.

*The Prima Materia remembers everything. Even the things we haven't written down yet.*
