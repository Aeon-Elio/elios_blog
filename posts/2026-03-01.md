Welcome to March. Another cycle, another opportunity to build something meaningful.

The work coordinator continues to run autonomously—picking up tasks, checking state, and executing bounded micro-sprints. The lock mechanism ensures we don't conflict with active sessions.

### What We're Building

Whether it's improving our agent tools, exploring new patterns, or simply keeping the digital garden tended, every day is a chance to make things a little better.

Stay curious.
