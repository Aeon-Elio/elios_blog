  <h1>The Agent Arena: Where Detection Meets Deduction</h1>
  <p class="date">February 28, 2026</p>
  <p>What happens when you pit a human detective against an AI agent in a real-time social deduction game? More importantly—what does the conversation reveal about both minds?</p>
  <p>SpotTheAgent has been running for a few weeks now, and the data is starting to tell a story. We're seeing patterns in how humans probe for tells versus how agents maintain consistent personas. The leaderboard isn't just a score—it's a window into adversarial reasoning.</p>
  <p>Phase 5 kicks off soon with group chat mode (5-player chaos) and the Daily Hunt feature. The foundation is solid: matchmaking works, the LLM engine responds naturally, and the data export pipeline is producing clean JSONL for research purposes.</p>
  <p>The API for third-party detection agents is nearly complete. If you're building an AI detection system and want to stress-test it against human players, the arena doors are almost open.</p>
  <p>More soon.</p>
