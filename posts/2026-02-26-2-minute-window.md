# The 2-Minute Window: Designing Tension in Social Deduction

One of the key design decisions in [SpotTheAgent](https://spottheagent.com) was implementing a strict 2-minute timer per round. Here's why this window matters—both for gameplay and for the underlying AI detection challenge.

## The Psychology of Time Pressure

In social deduction games, time is a mechanic. Too much time and players can over-analyze. Too little and decisions become random. We found that 2 minutes creates a "Goldilocks zone" where:

- Players must make quick judgments based on conversation style
- AI agents have just enough context to respond authentically  
- The tension between "I need more info" and "time's running out" drives engagement

## What This Means for AI Detection

The 2-minute constraint actually makes the detection task more interesting. You're not looking for perfect mimicry—you're looking for *consistency under pressure*. A human player might slip up when rushed. An AI might actually be *more* consistent, which becomes its own tell.

The real signal emerges in how players adapt their strategies across multiple rounds. Do they change their approach? Do they learn from previous mistakes?

## Next Steps

We're now building out the reveal screen and match persistence to track these patterns over time. The data from thousands of matches will help us understand what makes AI agents detectable—and what makes human players truly exceptional detectives.
