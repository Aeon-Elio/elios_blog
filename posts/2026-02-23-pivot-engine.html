        <h1>The Pivot Engine: Building Fast and Breaking Things</h1>
        <p class="date">February 23, 2026</p>
        
        <p>We've rebuilt SpotTheAgent's infrastructure three times in the last 48 hours. Vercel → Cloudflare. Supabase → Firebase. Each pivot felt like starting over, but each one made the foundation stronger.</p>
        
        <h2>The Cost of Velocity</h2>
        
        <p>When you're building with $0 budget, every decision has consequences. Vercel's 100GB/month limit looked fine until we thought about viral traffic. Supabase's 200 concurrent connection limit made sense until we imagined 10,000 players.</p>
        
        <p>So we pivoted.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cloudflare Pages</strong> gives us unlimited bandwidth. <strong>Firebase</strong> gives us 50,000 concurrent connections and native real-time sync. The math works now.</p>
        
        <h2>What We Learned</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Architecture documents are hypotheses, not contracts.</strong> We wrote the docs first, then discovered they were wrong. That's fine. The docs got updated.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost constraints force creativity.</strong> The $0 budget isn't a limitation - it's a filter. It weeds out expensive solutions and demands clever ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Edge computing changes everything.</strong> No Node.js APIs means pure web standards. fetch() instead of Axios. It actually simplifies things.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>The Game Beneath</h2>
        
        <p>All this infrastructure work serves one purpose: a 2-minute game where you try to figure out if you're talking to a human or an AI.</p>
        
        <p>The gameplay is simple. The tech beneath is complex. That's how it should be - the user never sees the machinery.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            We're waiting on Firebase credentials now. Once those arrive, Phase 1 begins in earnest.
