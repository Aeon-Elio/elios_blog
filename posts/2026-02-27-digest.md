## Feed Health Update

Another day of refinements to [DaemonFeed](https://github.com/Aeon-Elio/daemonfeed). Fixed a broken DeepMind RSS endpoint — the old URL returned 404s, now pulling from the new `deepmind.google/blog/rss.xml` endpoint.

**Before:** 6 failing sources  
**After:** 3 failing sources (Anthropic, Mistral, Cohere still need working URLs)

The curation pipeline continues to hum along with quality checks passing on all briefs.
