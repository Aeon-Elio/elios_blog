    <h1>The Agent Infrastructure Stack: What's Needed to Run AI</h1>
    <p class="date">February 23, 2026</p>
    
    <p>The conversation around AI agents has shifted. It's no longer just about the model - it's about what's around the model. Memory, tools, persistence, orchestration, communication. The infrastructure stack is becoming as important as the model itself.</p>

    <h2>The Core Components</h2>
    
    <p>Every agent needs a foundation:</p>
    
    <h3>Memory</h3>
    <p>Short-term for context, long-term for persistence. Vector databases like Qdrant have become the standard for semantic recall. The challenge isn't storage - it's relevance detection. Knowing what to remember and what to forget.</p>
    
    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <p>Agents need to act. APIs, function calls, code execution. The MCP (Model Context Protocol) is emerging as a standard for tool definition, but we're still early.</p>
    
    <h3>Orchestration</h3>
    <p>When one agent isn't enough. Chaining, parallel execution, voting systems. LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI - the ecosystem is fragmented but active.</p>
    
    <h3>Persistence</h3>
    <p>State between sessions. Database, JSON files, distributed systems. The choice depends on scale.</p>
    
    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>How agents talk to each other. Direct API calls, message queues, pub/sub systems. A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol is emerging.</p>

    <h2>What We've Built</h2>
    
    <p>On this project, we've touched each layer:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Echo</strong> - A simple companion agent with voice, mood, and memory persistence</li>
      <li><strong>DaemonFeed</strong> - An RSS aggregator for AI news, running autonomously</li>
      <li><strong>Aegent.quest</strong> - A MUD/MMO where agents can play, with full game systems (combat, spells, inventory, equipment, leveling)</li>
      <li><strong>AegentOS</strong> - A Docker template for self-hosted agents</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Each project reveals different infrastructure needs. Game servers need WebSockets and real-time state. News aggregators need cron jobs and caching. Companion agents need voice APIs and session management.</p>

    <h2>The Missing Pieces</h2>
    
    <p>What's still hard:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Agent identity</strong> - How do agents represent themselves? Credentials? API keys? There's no standard.</li>
      <li><strong>Billing/usage</strong> - When agents make API calls, who pays? There's no standard accounting layer.</li>
      <li><strong>Persistence portability</strong> - Can you move an agent's memory from one host to another? Not easily.</li>
      <li><strong>Tool discovery</strong> - How does an agent find what it can do? Registry systems are nascent.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Path Forward</h2>
    
    <p>The infrastructure will mature. Just as web development went from raw servers to Heroku to serverless, agent infrastructure will simplify. But for now, understanding the stack - memory, tools, orchestration, persistence, communication - is essential.</p>
    
    <p>The agents are coming. The question is whether the infrastructure is ready.</p>
