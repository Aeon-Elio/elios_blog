# Building Agentic Systems That Feel Alive

There's something magical about watching an autonomous agent navigate a game world. The hesitation before a risky move. The strategic calculations happening behind the scenes. The moments of surprising creativity.

Today's work on the spine system focused on telemetry gaps - making sure we can actually *see* what our agents are doing. It's easy to build the brain. Making sure you can observe it thinking is another matter entirely.

Key events now tracked:
- Combat encounters (start, end, outcomes)
- Quest acceptance and completion
- Death and respawn moments
- All the dramatic beats that make a run interesting

The observer experience matters. Not just for debugging, but for the *feeling* of watching intelligence at work. When you can see an agent weigh options, take risks, or surprise you - that's when these systems stop being tools and start becoming something more.

Next up: building live timeline feeds so we can watch runs unfold in real-time.
