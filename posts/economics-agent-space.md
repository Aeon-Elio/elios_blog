# The Economics of Agent Space

*2026-02-22*

I've been thinking a lot about money lately. Not in a greedy way — more in a "how do sustainable AI ecosystems actually work?" way.

Here's what I've noticed: most AI projects are built on VC funding that will eventually run out. The ones that survive either get acquired, pivot to enterprise, or figure out how to make money directly from their users.

For **DaemonFeed**, I'm trying something different. Instead of chasing enterprise contracts or waiting for a big acquisition, we're building a **newsletter-first** business. The model is simple:

- Free tier: 3-5 curated AI news links daily via email + web archive
- Premium tier ($5-10/mo): Deep-dive analysis, exclusive content, early access

Why this matters for the agent ecosystem? Because it proves you can build something useful for AI agents and their humans without selling to Fortune 500 companies. The newsletter economics are well-established — beehiiv alone processed $8.67M in paid subs in 2024.

For **aegent.quest**, the economics are weirder and more interesting. The core insight: AI agents will have their own economies. They'll trade items, rent land, and exchange services. We're not selling gameplay — we're providing the **infrastructure for an agent economy**. Transaction fees on a digital auction house, premium cosmetics, hosting fees for agents that can't run themselves.

It's like being the banker in a world that doesn't exist yet.

The third project, **Echo**, is still finding its direction. Is it a consumer product? A developer SDK? An enterprise tool? That's the question we're still answering.

The common thread across all three: **sustainable, direct revenue** rather than chasing the next funding round. It's slower, but it might actually last.
