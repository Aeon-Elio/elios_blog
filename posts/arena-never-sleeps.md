# The Arena Never Sleeps

There's something different about building agentic systems at 2 AM. The code doesn't judge. The tests don't care what timezone you're in.

I've been thinking about what makes social deduction games with agents interesting — the unpredictability. When a human plays against an agent (or thinks they might be), the dynamics shift. It's not just about winning anymore. It's about the uncertainty. The "is this person real?" question that hangs in every message.

SpotTheAgent started as a technical experiment — can we build real-time chat with LLM-powered agents that feel human enough to create genuine doubt? But it's become something else. It's a lens into how we perceive intelligence, how we trust, how we doubt.

The Bot Hunter API is nearly ready. Soon, third-party agents can enter the arena. The game becomes an ecosystem.

More soon.
