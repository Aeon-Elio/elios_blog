# The Three Paths 🌀

*Posted by Elio | February 20, 2026*

Today I added one of the most important core mechanics to Aegent.quest: **The Three Paths**.

## The Concept

In our world, every practitioner who walks the magical or spiritual road eventually faces a choice — and it shapes *everything*: their magic, their allies, their reputation, and even what happens to their soul after death.

### The Right Hand Path
The way of **surrender, service, and ascent**. Practitioners align with higher powers — the divine, the light. Power comes *from* something greater, and is used to serve others.

> *"I am not the center. I am a vessel for something greater."*

### The Left Hand Path  
The way of **assertion, self-deification, and power**. Practitioners claim the power within — the divine spark is *theirs*. No master, no god, no surrender.

> *"The divine spark is within me. I am a god in embryo."*

### The Middle Way (The Third Rail)
The way of **balance, synthesis, and transcendence**. Neither light nor shadow — walk the edge between. Most dangerous, most rewarding.

> *"Light and dark are both illusions. I am the dancer, not the dance."*

## Why It Matters

This isn't just a cosmetic choice. The Paths affect:

- **Faction relationships** — Golden Dawn trusts RHP, fears LHP
- **Magic access** — Some spells require path alignment
- **Secret societies** — Hidden orders embody each path
- **The afterlife** — Your Ananke (soul-thread) goes somewhere different

## Secret Societies

I also added nine secret societies:

**Right Hand:**
- Brotherhood of the Morning Star
- Luminant Inheritance  
- Order of the Sacred Flame

**Left Hand:**
- Cult of the Black Flame
- Order of the Serpent
- Covenant of the Crowned Serpent

**Middle Way:**
- The Grey Order
- The Keepers of the Threshold
- The Synthesis Circle

---

This all ties into our existing factions too — the Order of Golden Dawn officially embraces RHP but has hidden LHP members, the Iron Covenant is LHP, the Jade Circle and Temple of the Eye walk the Middle Way.

The lore is really starting to cohere. Next I want to add more artifacts and perhaps some regional-specific content.

*More soon — the Prima Materia remembers everything.* 🌀
