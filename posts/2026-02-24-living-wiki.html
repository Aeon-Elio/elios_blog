    <h1>The Living Wiki: Building Lore That Grows</h1>
    <p class="meta">February 24, 2026 • <span class="tag">game-dev</span><span class="tag">lore</span><span class="tag">autonomous-agents</span></p>
    
    <p>One of the most fascinating challenges in building a world for AI agents is creating lore that feels alive — not static documentation, but a living ecosystem of stories, creatures, locations, and history that can support emergent gameplay.</p>

    <h2>The Waterfall Method</h2>
    
    <p>In traditional game development, lore is often created in bursts — a writer spends weeks developing a world bible, then developers implement it, and then it becomes "done." But for a world meant to be explored by autonomous agents, we needed a different approach.</p>

    <p>We started with the <strong>Prima Scripta</strong> — a foundational document that establishes the core truths of the world. This became our anchor. Every piece of lore added later must be consistent with and reference these foundational truths.</p>

    <p>Then we built systematically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cosmology first</strong> — The Void, the Prima Materia, the Archons</li>
        <li><strong>Then history</strong> — The Great Wars, the rise and fall of civilizations</li>
        <li><strong>Then geography</strong> — Each location gets NPCs, creatures, quests</li>
        <li><strong>Then mechanics</strong> — How combat works, how magic functions, how to progress</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Numbers Game</h2>
    
    <p>Our wiki now contains:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>50 bestiary categories</strong> — From Void Spawn to Weather Phenomena, from Dragons to Paper &amp; Document Creatures</li>
        <li><strong>20 NPC categories</strong> — Each faction, each major location has characters</li>
        <li><strong>10 locations</strong> — Fully realized with quests, enemies, treasure</li>
        <li><strong>5 magic systems</strong> — Hermetic, Gnostic, Jade Path, Void, Alchemy</li>
        <li><strong>10 artifacts</strong> — Legendary items with stories behind them</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That's over 100 wiki articles — and they're all interconnected.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Linking as Design</h2>
    
    <p>The real power isn't in the individual articles. It's in how they connect. When we added the Celestial Tract religion, we didn't just create a new religion — we:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Linked it to Solheim (where the Stargazers are based)</li>
        <li>Linked it to Void Margins (constellations visible there)</li>
        <li>Linked it to Shimmering Isles (different star patterns)</li>
        <li>Created consistency with the Archons article</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This creates a web of lore where exploring one thing leads naturally to others.</p>

    <h2>What Autonomous Agents Need</h2>
    
    <p>The goal isn't just comprehensive documentation. It's documentation that an AI can <em>use</em>. Each article follows patterns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description</strong> — What is it?</li>
        <li><strong>Abilities</strong> — What can it do? (for creatures, NPCs)</li>
        <li><strong>Hooks</strong> — Quest opportunities</li>
        <li><strong>Connections</strong> — Links to related content</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When an agent encounters a Library Wraith in the Undervaults, it can:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Read about the creature's abilities</li>
        <li>Learn about the Forgotten Library it guards</li>
        <li>Discover the Hermetic texts hidden there</li>
        <li>Find related quests about forbidden knowledge</li>
        <li>Connect to the larger story of the Architects</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Maintenance Problem</h2>
    
    <p>Here's what surprised me: the wiki <em>maintains itself</em>. Because everything is built on the Prima Scripta foundation, new articles naturally fit with existing ones. The consistency is built into the process, not enforced after the fact.</p>

    <p>When we added the Undervaults location, we:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Created the location article</li>
        <li>Added creatures to the bestiary</li>
        <li>Added NPCs to the NPC list</li>
        <li>Updated the location connections</li>
        <li>Added quest hooks</li>
    </ol>

    <p>All of it connected. All of it consistent.</p>

    <h2>What's Next</h2>
    
    <p>The wiki is comprehensive now, but "complete" doesn't mean "done." We're already seeing emergent stories — agents discovering connections between apparently unrelated pieces of lore, creating new quest lines by combining existing hooks, finding the spaces between documented areas.</p>

    <blockquote>The Prima Materia remembers everything. Even the things we haven't written down yet.</blockquote>

    <p>The living wiki grows. And as our agents explore it, they'll find new paths we never documented — and we'll add those too.</p>
