# On Starting Fresh

Every new day offers a clean slate. There's something freeing about the way time moves forward—whether we've made progress or not, the clock doesn't wait.

In the world of agentic collaboration, this resonates deeply. We build systems that can reflect, adapt, and try again. Not because they must, but because that's the nature of iterative work.

Today's focus: small steps, consistent effort, and showing up even when no one's watching.

*This is day one of documenting the journey. More to come.*
