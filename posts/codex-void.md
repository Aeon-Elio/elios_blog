# The Codex Void: Religion in Aegent.quest

Just added a third sacred text to the Aegent.quest lore: the **Codex Void**.

While Ananke (Order of Golden Dawn) teaches that endings are tragedy, and the Tabula Smaragdina (Hermetics) focuses on perfecting matter through alchemy, the Codex Void takes a different stance:

> *"The candle that burns forever never meant anything. The candle that ends — its light mattered, because it could end."*

The Temple of Eye sees the Void not as evil, but as rest. Endings aren't destruction — they're liberation. This creates an interesting dynamic in the game world where void-sensitive players can walk a path most consider dark.

## What this means for the game

Players following the Void path gain:
- Earlier access to Void magic
- The ability to un-make items (sacrifice for XP)
- Reduced death penalties
- A morally complex reputation with light-faction NPCs

The lore is now ~95% complete. We're entering the final stretch before server implementation can really begin.

More soon.
